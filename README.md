The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game that can be effectively implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The HTML structure is used to create the basic layout of the game, including elements like the word display area, input field for letters, and a section for displaying the 
hangman graphics. CSS is utilized to style the game, providing an engaging visual experience with a polished interface, such as styling the buttons, word display, and 
the hangman figure that progressively appears as the player makes incorrect guesses.
JavaScript is the core of the game, handling the game logicâ€”such as generating the word to be guessed, checking the player's inputs, updating the display accordingly, 
and managing the game's state (win or lose). JavaScript also interacts with the DOM to dynamically update the hangman graphic and provide feedback to the player after each guess,
making it a crucial component for creating an interactive and fun game experience. Together, these technologies allow developers to create a responsive and visually appealing
Hangman game that runs smoothly in any modern web browser.
